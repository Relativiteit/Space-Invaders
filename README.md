# Roadmap learning pygame 
These are the tutorials that will be done to gain a basic understanding of pygame.
The first games will be as simple as possible and with little to no changes to the source material.
Hopefully staying true to KISS it will be possible to make a fun tool for me and my friends later on this summer.

## 1. Space-Invaders - Done 14-05-2021
A 2 player shooter where the objective is to shoot down eachother's spaceship.

##### Lesson learned 
How to map keys to actions, how to render objects, how to setup events, how to register multiple keystrokes at the same time.

##### What can be improved?
The file is messy with allot of constants on the top of the file. Next small game use OOP to structure the functions in a class. 

## 2. Snake 
A classic game where the objective is to get as much tokens in the screens as possible, growing your players body. While not touching your own body.
